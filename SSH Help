So I am getting the error message "ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer" or 
"ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host" and I dont know what to do, 
I have no experience with SSH stuff at all, but I could really use someone to help explain to me Exactly 
what I need to do to stop that from happening, in very clear detail very exact please, and thank you :)
